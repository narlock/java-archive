package Inheritance;
/*
 * Author: Anthony Narlock
 * 
 * Description: This package describes the basics of inheritance inside of OOP using Java.
 * 
 * Inheritance is essentially the concept in which properties from one class can be used in another.
 * 
 * To describe the simple use of inheritance, I will link the following image inside of this package to describe the relationship
 * between the classes that are in this package.
 * 
 * Animal represents the top of the classes. It is a parent class to the child classes Person, Dog, and Cat
 * The Person class is also a parent class to Student and Teacher.
 * 
 * The way classes "get" inheritance in Java is through the keyword extends.
 * From here, the child class will have access to all methods, attributes, etc. of the parent class.
 * 
 * This does not work the opposite way. 
 * To understand this: A dog can be an animal (dog=child, animal=parent)
 * however, not all dogs are animals. (dog can never be parent class of animal)
 * 
 * Note: only 1 class can be inherited. You cannot extend multiple classes. (You can with interfaces though!)
