PROJECT TITLE: PokemonGame
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: To create a functional Pokemon RPG game using our poor java skills

VERSION: INDEV 0.1
LEAD DEVELOPMENT: Anthony Narlock, Spencer Ekstrom

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Control Ideas:

"enter" will serve as the "A" button when playing a Pokemon game, thus making this the primary key of selecting choices, and skipping through dialouge.

"shift" will serve as the Hero's inventory key. Making sure the character is in the correct game state and not in any other circumstance will probably make the inventory work (ex: If the game state is in a battle, we don't want the player to open their inventory)

The player will move with the general WASD keys.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Ideas:

At the beginning of the game, ask the user questions in which set the basic variables of the game, for example the basic player name or player gender (this would serve as the intro bit that usual Pokemon games have with the exception that we don't need to hype it up as much; get to the point and set variables)

After the varibles are set a startgame boolean can be present and begin the game. (setting startgame = true and hopefully putting the player in their house)
